Qsismixer is a frontend gui to control the mixer for Focusrite's Scarlett 6i6 USB sound card on Linux.
The card has a powerful hardware mixer. I find this program easier to use than alsamixer on the terminal or generic mixer GUI's.
Now including static configurations: qsismix can save and load arbitrary configurations from the command line

TODO:
an options menu would be cool
write code to dynamically generate the visual forms


PLEASE NOTE: ALSA version 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 use different identifying control numbers internally to refer to the 6i6's controls. These control codes are compiled into Qsismixer at build time. Therefore, you must build Qsismixer against the ALSA headers for the same version as the ALSA libraries that are installed on your system. Eg, if you built Qsismixer against ALSA < 1.1.2, and then update your system to ALSA >= 1.1.2, you will have to rebuild Qsismixer against the new ALSA library in order for the program to function properly.

Error messages related to this include:
looking for string 'Scarlett 6i6 USB-Sync'', got string 'Internal Validity'
looking for string 'Scarlett 6i6 USB-Sync'', got string 'Master Playback Volume'

Updated on 1/19/18 to correct for bug introduced by new alsa version 1.1.5: "looking for string 'Scarlett 6i6 USB-Sync'', got string 'Scarlett 6i6 USB-Sync Clock Source'"
When your distro updates to alsa 1.1.5, you will likely get this error and will have to recompile with the update in order to use the program.

Updated on 4/3/18 to correct for bug introduced by a new system update: "looking for string 'Scarlett 6i6 USB-Sync'', got string 'S/PDIF Validity'. If you get this error, uncomment line 13 in include/mixsisctrl.h so it reads:
#define NEW_ALSA_CTRL_SCHEME

Updated on 11/9/19 due to ALSA update 1.1.7.
